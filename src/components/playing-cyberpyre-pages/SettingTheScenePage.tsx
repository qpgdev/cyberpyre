        You have no idea what unlife was like in the old days.  Well, in MY old days, anyway.  
        Hiding in gutters and filth, holding in the breath that you no longer had, just prayin' the 
        flames wouldn’t reach you as the Second Inquisition burned your haven to the ground.  
        It hardly even mattered if you got away - it never took them long to find you again.  
        For us, the first few decades after the turn of the century were filled with nothing 
        but fire and ash.  We were backed into a corner.  No matter where you were, no matter 
        WHO you were, you could already smell the smoke. There was nowhere left to go. <br></br> <br></br>

        The Circle made a decision - learn how to use human tech.  Sure, it was risky.  
        When you’d never used a computer before, you were half as likely to expose your IP
        to the Inquisition as you were to check your email. Still, I’d never seen Anarchs 
        and Cam work together like that.  The young teaching the old, the old actually listening.  
        It was beautiful, in a sort of fucked up way.  The LaSombra and Nosferatu took a particular 
        liking to tech - you know how they love their secrets.  Same as now, most of the skeletons 
        folks had in their closets were either on their hard drive or buried in their browser history. <br></br> <br></br>

        It was slow going, and a lot of us didn't make it, but we made it work. However we had to do it, we made it happen.  
        Blackmail, coercion, intimidation, bribes, the works.  Things we’d already been doing to govs for centuries - 
        we just had more information, now.  Pushing the right people out of office, 
        letting the right ones in.  The church saw numbers drops, which saw tithes drop, and 
        the Inquisition started finding it hard to mount a classified global assault 
        without a single government willing to grant them the funding.<br></br> <br></br>

        Around that time, we bought out a bunch of corpos, founded a few of the major megacorps.  
        That neolibertarian movement was just starting to take off, and if you were a Kindred with a millenia 
        worth of wealth to be throwing around, you wanted to invest in tech.  Besides, a lot of the companies had 
        already built the infrastructure we needed.  Most of their shit already had spyware installed before we ever even 
        thought about buying them out.  All we had to do was have Alexa stop listening for what brand of toilet paper you use and
        start listening to the stuff that would get us some real leverage - a casual slur, a 
        rendezvous with the mistress, that kind of stuff.  Humans like to play the good guys, but if you focus the microscope 
        on a few of them, you start to find out that they aren’t much better than we are. <br></br> <br></br>

        When it was over, the Cam kicked the Anarch Barons to the curb. They’d been planning a coup, the Circle got wind of it, 
        blah blah blah - a tale as old as time, right?  They left an open letter for the rest of the rabble - those who weren’t in 
        leadership - to prove ourselves in the corpos.  To be honest, it isn’t a bad gig.  I’ve worked there for half a century now.  
        We’ve gone pretty hard on advertising to the neo-gothic vampire wannabe.  Half the attacks that you’d expect came from 
        Kindred are actually just a mortal cyberpsycho chromed out in the newest neovamp tech that just forgot to take their 
        immunoblockers that morning.  Having a few harmless sips is tame by comparison.  Flash your corpo ID, and cops tend to look the other 
          way if you get a bit too thirsty on a night out. <br></br> <br></br>

        Anyway, you were saying we have to be careful, but that’s the neat part - we kind of don’t.  Not anymore.  The Masquerade 
        is still on, but no one can tell if it’s a Kindred or a cyberpsycho tearing someone’s throat out.  Who has the time to keep 
        track of every murder nowadays?  Mortals have short memories.  <br></br> <br></br>
        Rest easy, choom.  We won.
