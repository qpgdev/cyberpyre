      <p>
        Cyberpyre is an unofficial supplement for Vampire: the Masquerade - 5th Edition, a tabletop role-playing game 
        which is sometimes colloquially referred to by players as V5.  If you are interested in this supplement, I 
        would recommend finding a copy of the V5 Corebook, and potentially the V5 Playerâ€™s Guide.  While references to 
        core mechanics of V5 will be provided, this supplement will largely assume that you have played V5 before, or 
        are at least familiar with most of the core mechanics.  If a core concept of V5 is more thoroughly explained in the 
        source material, references to the official books will be provided as necessary.
